# MagicWorld

This project is to design and build a database system to manage all information of a virtual magic world. For example, magicians' information, magics, shops, and ingredients.

I designed ER-diagram and relational schema from description. Then, I wrote sql statements based on designed schema to create tables and insert initial data using JDBC.
I also implemented [dynamic webpages](https://github.com/joohan-lee/MagicWorld/tree/master/WebContent) to insert, modify, view, and delete information about magic world using JSP.

- SKILLS: JSP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Apache Tomcat, MariaDB, JDBC
